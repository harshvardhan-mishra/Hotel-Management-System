# Hotel-Management-System
Hotel Management System is a service primarily designed for the need of reserving  tables at a particular hotel before arriving at the hotel
In our daily life, we can see many people in the Hotels who are waiting for a long 
time for getting their food. It is the most common problem faced by the people 
these days. Due to this kind of delay in time people might miss their flights, trains 
and sometimes even some important meetings which cause lots of loss to the 
individual. When people are new to an area then they wonâ€™t be having any idea of 
the Hotels in his/her surroundings and what type of food will be served in that 
Hotel. Even we can find some situations where people will be waiting outside the 
Hotel for a table to be vacated. Sometimes while booking in a telephone there is a 
chance of misplacing the names of the customers which arises problems. By keeping 
these problems faced by every man in this modern civilization we generated an idea 
of creating an application which would solve all above stated problems. This idea 
has its own kind of perspective which wipes away the problems which are faced in 
hotels and creates an application where customers can browse and reserve the 
tables with just a few clicks.
